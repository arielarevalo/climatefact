# Summary for Policymakers

B.5.3 If the annual ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \ ( 5 0 \% ) ,$ and deplete more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( 6 7 \% )$ . Estimates of future ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructures without additional abatement42 already exceed the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( 5 0 \% )$ (high confidence). Projected cumulative future ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions over the lifetime of existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure, if historical operating patterns are maintained and without additional abatement43, are approximately equal to the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with a likelihood of $83 \% 4 4$ (high confidence). {2.3.1, 3.3.1, Figure 3.5}

B.5.4 Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about four fifths45 of the total carbon budget for a $50 \%$ probability of limiting global warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ (central estimate about $2 9 0 0 \mathsf { G t C O } _ { 2 } )$ ), and to about two thirds46 of the total carbon budget for a $67 \%$ probability to limit global warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ (central estimate about $3 5 5 0 \mathsf { G t C O } _ { 2 } )$ ). {3.3.1, Figure 3.5}

# Mitigation Pathways

B.6 All global modelled pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \left( > 5 0 \% \right)$ with no or limited overshoot, and those that limit warming to ${ \sf z } ^ { \circ } { \sf C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ , involve rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. Global net zero $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions are reached for these pathway categories, in the early 2050s and around the early 2070s, respectively. (high confidence) {3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.5, Table 3.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)

B.6.1 Global modelled pathways provide information on limiting warming to different levels; these pathways, particularly their sectoral and regional aspects, depend on the assumptions described in Box SPM.1. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \left( > 5 0 \% \right)$ with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ are characterized by deep, rapid, and, in most cases, immediate GHG emissions reductions. Pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \left( > 5 0 \% \right)$ with no or limited overshoot reach net zero ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ in the early 2050s, followed by net negative ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions. Those pathways that reach net zero GHG emissions do so around the 2070s. Pathways that limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ reach net zero ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions in the early 2070s. Global GHG emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025 in global modelled pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 5 0 \% )$ ) with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ and assume immediate action.
