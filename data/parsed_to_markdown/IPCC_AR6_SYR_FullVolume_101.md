# Global modelled pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \left( > 5 0 \% \right)$ with no or limited overshoot reach net zero $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ emissions around 2050

Figure 3.6: Total GHG, CO2 and CH4 emissions and timing of reaching net zero in different mitigation pathways. Top row: GHG, CO2 and CH4 emissions over time (in GtCO2eq) with historical emissions, projected emissions in line with policies implemented until the end of 2020 (grey), and pathways consistent with temperature goals in colour (blue, purple, and brown, respectively). Panel (a) (left) shows pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 5 0 \% )$ with no or limited overshoot (C1) and Panel (b) (right) shows pathways that limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ (C3). Bottom row: Panel (c) shows median (vertical line), likely (bar) and very likely (thin lines) timing of reaching net zero GHG and CO2 emissions for global modelled pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 5 0 \% )$ with no or limited overshoot (C1) (left) or $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ (C3) (right). {WGIII Figure SPM.5}

# 3.3.3 Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation

All global modelled pathways that limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \left( > 6 7 \% \right)$ or lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors (see also 4.1, 4.5). Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers (see also 4.5, Figure 4.4). Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access.

Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero ${ \bf { C } } { \bf { 0 } } _ { 2 }$ and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage (CCS) to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with $\complement ( \mathsf { S } ,$ demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non- $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ GHG emissions, and $\mathsf { C D R } ^ { 1 3 6 }$ . In global modelled pathways that limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ or below, almost all electricity is supplied
