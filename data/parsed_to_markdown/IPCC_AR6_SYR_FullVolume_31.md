Figure SPM.3: Projected risks and impacts of climate change on natural and human systems at different global warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850–1900 levels. Projected risks and impacts shown on the maps are based on outputs from different subsets of Earth system and impact models that were used to project each impact indicator without additional adaptation. WGII provides further assessment of the impacts on human and natural systems using these projections and additional lines of evidence. (a) Risks of species losses as indicated by the percentage of assessed species exposed to potentially dangerous temperature conditions, as defined by conditions beyond the estimated historical (1850–2005) maximum mean annual temperature experienced by each species, at GWLs of $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } , 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ $3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . Underpinning projections of temperature are from 21 Earth system models and do not consider extreme events impacting ecosystems such as the Arctic. (b) Risks to human health as indicated by the days per year of population exposure to hyperthermic conditions that pose a risk of mortality from surface air temperature and humidity conditions for historical period (1991–2005) and at GWLs of $1 . 7 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 2 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (mean $= 1 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ;$ 13 climate models), $2 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } - 3 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $、 2 . 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ;$ 16 climate models) and $4 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } { - } 5 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( 4 . 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ;$ 15 climate models). Interquartile ranges of GWLs by 2081–2100 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The presented index is consistent with common features found in many indices included within WGI and WGII assessments. (c) Impacts on food production: (c1) Changes in maize yield by 2080–2099 relative to 1986–2005 at projected GWLs of $1 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } - 2 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \ ( 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ) , 3 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } - 4 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \ ( 4 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ and $3 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \mathrm { - } 6 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( 4 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ . Median yield changes from an ensemble of 12 crop models, each driven by bias-adjusted outputs from 5 Earth system models, from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP).
