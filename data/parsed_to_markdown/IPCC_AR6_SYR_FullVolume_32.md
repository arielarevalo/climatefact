2080–2099 compared to 1986–2005 for current growing regions $( > 1 0$ ha), with the corresponding range of future global warming levels shown under SSP1- 2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. Hatching indicates areas where ${ < } 7 0 \%$ of the climate-crop model combinations agree on the sign of impact. (c2) Change in maximum fisheries catch potential by 2081–2099 relative to 1986–2005 at projected GWLs of $0 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } { - 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ $( 1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ and $3 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } - 5 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( 4 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ . GWLs by 2081–2100 under RCP2.6 and $\mathsf { R C P 8 . 5 . }$ . Hatching indicates where the two climate-fisheries models disagree in the direction of change. Large relative changes in low yielding regions may correspond to small absolute changes. Biodiversity and fisheries in Antarctica were not analysed due to data limitations. Food security is also affected by crop and fishery failures not presented here. {3.1.2, Figure 3.2, Cross-Section Box.2} (Box SPM.1)

# Risks are increasing with every increment of warming

a) High risks are now assessed to occur at lower global warming levels

b) Risks differ by system

c) Risks to coastal geographies increase with sea level rise and depend on responses
