# A. Current Status and Trends

# Observed Warming and its Causes

A.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching $1 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence). {2.1, Figure 2.1, Figure 2.2}

A.1.1 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to $1 . 2 0 ] ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ^ { 5 }$ higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–19006 , with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to $1 . 8 3 ] ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to $1 . 0 1 ] ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ . Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the $2 1 ^ { \mathfrak { s t } }$ century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to $1 . 1 0 ] ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}

A.1.2 The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to $2 0 1 0 { - } 2 0 1 9 ^ { \prime }$ is $0 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $1 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ with a best estimate of $1 . 0 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } .$ Over this period, it is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed a warming of $1 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ^ { 8 } .$ , and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of $0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $0 . 8 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by $- 0 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ to $+ 0 . 1 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C ,$ and internal variability changed it by $- 0 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $+ 0 . 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ . {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}

A.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions from 1850 to 2019 were $2 4 0 0 \pm 2 4 0 \mathsf { G t C O } _ { 2 }$ of which more than half $( 5 8 \% )$ occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about $4 2 \%$ occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high confidence). In 2019, atmospheric ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 million years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per billion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}

A.1.4 Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be $5 9 \pm 6 . 6 \mathsf { G t C O } _ { 2 } – \mathsf { e }$ 9 in 2019, about $12 \%$ ( $6 . 5 \mathsf { G t C O } _ { 2 }$ -eq) higher than in 2010 and $54 \%$ (21 $\mathsf { G t C O } _ { 2 }$ -eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions occurring in ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ -FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade on record, while the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 $( 1 . 3 \% \ y \Gamma ^ { - 1 } )$ was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 $( 2 . 1 \% \ y \Gamma ^ { - 1 } )$ . In 2019, approximately $7 9 \%$ of global GHG
