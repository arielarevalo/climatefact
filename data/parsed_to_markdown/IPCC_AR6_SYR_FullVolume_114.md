Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, and water availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in most mountain regions (high confidence). {WGII TS C.4.2}

• The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation (high confidence ) will increase rain-generated local flooding (medium confidence ).  {WGI Figure SPM.6, WGI SPM B.2.2; WGII TS C.4.5 }

Multiple climate change risks will increasingly compound and cascade in the near term (high confidence). Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming (high confidence ) including concurrent heatwaves and drought. Risks to health and food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by heatinduced labour productivity losses (high confidence) (Figure 4.3). These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions (high confidence ). Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to food systems, human settlements, infrastructure and health will make these risks more severe and more difficult to manage, including when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics (high confidence ). Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs (high confidence ). Increasing transboundary risks are projected across the food, energy and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows (high confidence ) and may interact with impacts from other crises such as pandemics. Risks also arise from some responses intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures, such as afforestation of naturally unforested land or poorly implemented bioenergy compounding climate-related risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods (high confidence ) (see Section 3.4.1 and 4.5). {WGI SPM.2.7; WGII SPM B.2.1, WGII SPM B.5, WGII SPM B.5.1, WGII SPM B.5.2, WGII SPM B.5.3, WGII SPM B.5.4, WGII Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7; WGIII SPM C.11.2; SRCCL SPM A.5, SRCCL SPM A.6.5 } (Figure 4.3 )

With every increment of global warming losses and damages will increase (very high confidence), become increasingly difficult to avoid and be strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations (high confidence). Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages will be unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. (high confidence ).  {WGII SPM B.4, WGII SPM C.3, WGII SPM C.3.5}
