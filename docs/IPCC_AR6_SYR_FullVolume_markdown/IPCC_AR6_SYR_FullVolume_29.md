# With every increment of global warming, regional changes in mean climate and extremes become more widespread and pronounced

Figure SPM.2: Projected changes of annual maximum daily maximum temperature, annual mean total column soil moisture and annual maximum 1-day precipitation at global warming levels of $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ $3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ and $4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ relative to 1850–1900. Projected (a) annual maximum daily temperature change ${ \mathrm { ( } } ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ) _ { i }$ (b) annual mean total column soil moisture change (standard deviation), (c) annual maximum 1-day precipitation change $( \% )$ . The panels show CMIP6 multi-model median changes. In panels (b) and (c), large positive relative changes in dry regions may correspond to small absolute changes. In panel (b), the unit is the standard deviation of interannual variability in soil moisture during 1850–1900. Standard deviation is a widely used metric in characterising drought severity. A projected reduction in mean soil moisture by one standard deviation corresponds to soil moisture conditions typical of droughts that occurred about once every six years during 1850–1900. The WGI Interactive Atlas (https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/) can be used to explore additional changes in the climate system across the range of global warming levels presented in this figure. {Figure 3.1, Cross-Section Box.2}

# Climate Change Impacts and Climate-Related Risks

B.2 For any given future warming level, many climate-related risks are higher than assessed in AR5, and projected long-term impacts are up to multiple times higher than currently observed (high confidence). Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming (very high confidence). Climatic and non-climatic risks will increasingly interact, creating compound and cascading risks that are more complex and difficult to manage (high confidence). {Cross-Section Box.2, 3.1, 4.3, Figure 3.3, Figure 4.3} (Figure SPM.3, Figure SPM.4)
