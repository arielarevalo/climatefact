# Section 2

Projected cumulative future ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions over the lifetime of existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement95 exceed the total cumulative net ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions in pathways that limit warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \ ( > 5 0 \% )$ with no or limited overshoot. They are approximately equal to total cumulative net ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions in pathways that limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with a likelihood of $8 3 \% 9 6$ (see Figure 3.5). Limiting warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ or lower will result in stranded assets. About $80 \%$ of coal, $5 0 \%$ of gas, and $30 \%$ of oil reserves cannot be burned and emitted if warming is limited to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ . Significantly more reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } .$ (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B.7, WGIII Box 6.3}
