# Projected global GHG emissions from NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming will exceed $1 . 5 \textdegree$ and also make it harder after 2030 to limit warming to below ${ \bf \nabla } ^ { 2 \circ } \mathbb { C }$

Figure 2.5 Global GHG emissions of modelled pathways (funnels in Panel a), and projected emission outcomes from near-term policy assessments for 2030 (Panel b). Panel a shows global GHG emissions over 2015-2050 for four types of assessed modelled global pathways:

- Trend from implemented policies: Pathways with projected near-term GHG emissions in line with policies implemented until the end of 2020 and extended with comparable ambition levels beyond 2030 (29 scenarios across categories C5–C7, WGIII Table SPM.2). - Limit to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ or return warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 5 0 \% )$ after a high overshoot, NDCs until 2030: Pathways with GHG emissions until 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26, followed by accelerated emissions reductions likely to limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ (C3b, WGIII Table SPM.2) or to return warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with a probability of $5 0 \%$ or greater after high overshoot (subset of 42 scenarios from C2, WGIII Table SPM.2). - Limit to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \left( > 6 7 \% \right)$ with immediate action: Pathways that limit warming to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ $( > 6 7 \% )$ with immediate action after 2020 (C3a, WGIII Table SPM.2). - Limit to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \left( > 5 0 \% \right)$ with no or limited overshoot: Pathways limiting warming to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with no or limited overshoot (C1, WGIII Table SPM.2 C1). All these pathways assume immediate action after 2020. Past GHG emissions for 2010-2015 used to project global warming outcomes of the modelled pathways are shown by a black line. Panel b shows a snapshot of the GHG emission ranges of the modelled pathways in 2030 and projected emissions outcomes from near-term policy assessments in 2030 from WGIII Chapter 4.2 (Tables 4.2 and 4.3; median and full range). GHG emissions are $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ -equivalent using GWP100 from AR6 WGI. {WGIII Figure SPM.4, WGIII 3.5, 4.2, Table 4.2, Table 4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4} (Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.2)
