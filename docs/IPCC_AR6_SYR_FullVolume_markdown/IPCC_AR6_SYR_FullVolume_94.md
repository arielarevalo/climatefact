long-term planning and implementation of adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {WGII SPM C.4, WGII SPM.C.4.1, WGII SPM C.4.2, WGII SPM C.4.3}

Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge as it implies both dealing with slow onset changes and increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events (high confidence). Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise (high confidence). Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation (high confidence). These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes (high confidence). Ecosystem-based solutions such as wetlands provide co-benefits for the environment and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for flood defences (medium confidence), but have site-specific physical limits, at least above $1 . 5 \mathrm { ^ \circ C }$ of global warming (high confidence) and lose effectiveness at high rates of sea level rise beyond 0.5 to $1 \ c m \ y \mathsf { r } ^ { - 1 }$ (medium confidence). Seawalls can be maladaptive as they effectively reduce impacts in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan (high confidence). {WGI SPM C.2.5; WGII SPM C.2.8, WGII SPM C.4.1; WGII 13.10, WGII Cross-Chapter Box SLR; SROCC SPM B.9, SROCC SPM C.3.2, SROCC Figure SPM.4, SROCC Figure SPM.5c} (Figure 3.4)
