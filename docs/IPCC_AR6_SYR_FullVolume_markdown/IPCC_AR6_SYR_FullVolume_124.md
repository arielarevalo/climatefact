# Near-term adaptation and mitigation actions have more synergies than trade-offs with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Synergies and trade-offs depend on context and scale

Figure 4.5: Potential synergies and trade-offs between the portfolio of climate change mitigation and adaptation options and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This figure presents a high-level summary of potential synergies and trade-offs assessed in WGII Figure SPM.4b and WGIII Figure SPM.8, based on the qualitative and quantitative assessment of each individual mitigation or option. The SDGs serve as an analytical framework for the assessment of different sustainable development dimensions, which extend beyond the time frame of 2030 SDG targets. Synergies and trade-offs across all individual options within a sector/system are aggregated into sector/system potentials for the whole mitigation or adaptation portfolio. The length of each bar represents the total number of mitigation or adaptation options under each system/sector. The number of adaptation and mitigation options vary across system/sector, and have been normalised to $100 \%$ so that bars are comparable across mitigation, adaptation, system/sector, and SDGs. Positive links shown in WGII Figure SPM.4b and WGIII Figure SPM.8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of synergies, represented here by the blue proportion within the bars. Negative links shown in WGII Figure $\mathsf { S P M . 4 b }$ and WGIII Figure SPM.8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of trade-offs and is represented by orange proportion within the bars. ‘Both synergies and trade-offs’ shown in WGII Figure SPM.4b WGIII Figure SPM.8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of ‘both synergies and trade-off’, represented by the striped proportion within the bars. The ‘white’ proportion within the bar indicates limited evidence/ no evidence/ not assessed. Energy systems comprise all mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 and WGII Figure $S P M . 4 b$ for adaptation. Urban and infrastructure comprises all mitigation options listed
