# Remaining carbon budgets to limit warming to $1 . 5 \%$ could soon be exhausted, and those for ${ \sf z } ^ { \circ } { \sf C }$ largely depleted

Remaining carbon budgets are similar to emissions from use of existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure, without additional abatement

Figure 3.5: Cumulative past, projected, and committed emissions, and associated global temperature changes. Panel (a) Assessed remaining carbon budgets to limit warming more likely than not to $1 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } ,$ to $2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with a $8 3 \%$ and $6 7 \%$ likelihood, compared to cumulative emissions corresponding to constant 2019 emissions until 2030, existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructures (in $\mathsf { G t C O } _ { 2 } ^ { \prime }$ . For remaining carbon budgets, thin lines indicate the uncertainty due to the contribution of non- $C 0 _ { 2 }$ warming. For lifetime emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure, thin lines indicate the assessed sensitivity range. Panel (b) Relationship between cumulative ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions and the increase in global surface temperature. Historical data (thin black line) shows historical ${ \mathsf { C } } { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions versus observed global surface temperature increase relative to the period 1850-1900. The grey range with its central line shows a corresponding estimate of the human-caused share of historical warming. Coloured areas show the assessed very likely range of global surface temperature projections, and thick coloured central lines show the median estimate as a function of cumulative ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions for the selected scenarios SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Projections until 2050 use the cumulative ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ emissions of each respective scenario, and the projected global warming includes the contribution from all anthropogenic forcers. {WGI SPM D.1, WGI Figure SPM.10, WGI Table SPM.2; WGIII SPM B.1, WGIII SPM B.7, WGIII 2.7; SR1.5 SPM C.1.3}
