# Global Warming Levels (GWLs)

For many climate and risk variables, the geographical patterns of changes in climatic impact-drivers110 and climate impacts for a level of global warming111 are common to all scenarios considered and independent of timing when that level is reached. This motivates the use of GWLs as a dimension of integration. {WGI Box SPM.1.4, WGI TS.1.3.2; WGII Box SPM.1} (Figure 3.1, Figure 3.2)

# Risks

Dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards, exposure and vulnerability of the affected human society, species, or ecosystems result in risks arising from climate change. AR6 assesses key risks across sectors and regions as well as providing an updated assessment of the Reasons for Concern (RFCs) – five globally aggregated categories of risk that evaluate risk accrual with increasing global surface temperature. Risks can also arise from climate change mitigation or adaptation responses when the response does not achieve its intended objective, or when it results in adverse effects for other societal objectives. {WGII SPM A, WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII Box TS.1, WGII Figure TS.4; SR1.5 Figure SPM.2; SROCC Errata Figure SPM.3; SRCCL Figure SPM.2} (3.1.2, Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1, Figure 3.3)
