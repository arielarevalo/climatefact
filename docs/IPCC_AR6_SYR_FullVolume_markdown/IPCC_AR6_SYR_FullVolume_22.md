# Adverse impacts from human-caused climate change will continue to intensify

a) Observed widespread and substantial impacts and related losses and damages attributed to climate change

# b) Impacts are driven by changes in multiple physical climate conditions, which are increasingly attributed to human influence

Attribution of observed physical climate changes to human influence:

c) The extent to which current and future generations will experience a hotter and different world depends on choices now and in the near term   
Figure SPM.1: (a) Climate change has already caused widespread impacts and related losses and damages on human systems and altered terrestrial, freshwater and ocean ecosystems worldwide. Physical water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water quality and demand for water. Global mental health and displacement assessments reflect only assessed regions. Confidence levels reflect the assessment of attribution of the observed impact to climate change. (b) Observed impacts are connected to physical climate changes including many that have been attributed to human influence such as the selected climatic impact-drivers shown. Confidence and likelihood levels reflect the assessment of attribution of the observed climatic impact-driver to human influence. (c) Observed (1900–2020) and projected (2021–2100) changes in global surface temperature (relative to 1850-1900), which are linked to changes in climate conditions and impacts, illustrate how the climate has already changed and will change along the lifespan of three
